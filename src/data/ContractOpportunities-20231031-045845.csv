Individuals who violate the procurement integrity provisions may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, and administrative remedies. The penalties are discussed under 41 U.S.C. Chapter 21 (4) and FAR 3.104-8. It is essential for all potential contractors to be fully aware of and compliant with these regulations. Contracting officers and contracting specialists, who announce contract opportunities on SAM.gov, act as the liaisons between the Federal Government and potential contractors. As such, all inquiries, questions, or concerns from interested contractors should be sent exclusively to the contracting officer or contracting specialist who posted the contract opportunity announcement.

After accumulating all necessary information to address these inquiries, the contracting officer or contracting specialist will then update the related contract opportunity announcement and ensure its public accessibility on SAM.gov to uphold transparency and the integrity of the procurement process. Private firms must be able to compete for the government’s business on a scrupulously fair basis. Fairness is a pre-requisite of government acquisition due to the government’s unique position as representatives of the citizens of the United States.

I notice that there is no formal site visit scheduled, but we would like to visit the site on our own time to familiarize ourselves with the existing conditions.  When searching on Google maps for directions to the site, it says that the Minnetonka Cave is ""Temporarily Closed.""  Would it still be possible for us to drive up the road to view the existing structures to be removed and the overlook area where the deck will be constructed?  Or is the road up to this site closed, as well? Please advise if we need to coordinate with you to schedule a time to visit the site, or if all construction areas can be viewed without any obstructions or needing a Forest Service escort. A 1. The gate is closed for the season. Potential offerors can park at the gate and walk in approximately ½ mile or contact Steve Jenkins 208-497-7047 or steven.jenkins@usda.gov to arrange for someone to open the gate. No questions regarding the actual project may be asked to Steve Jenkins. All questions need to be sent to Elizabeth Ratcliff at elizabeth.ratcliff@usda.gov.  Q 2. Please specify the width (size) of the retaining wall footing shown on Detail 1 of Drawing S201. A 2. Footing sizes are listed in the footing schedule on sheet S003.   Q 3. Please clarify the elevations curves or bias drop of points 302, 303, 304 and 305. Based on drawings and pictures, it is hard to identify if there is a cliff right below the point 304.  A 3. Existing surface points aren’t available. Slope is approximately 25%. Q4. Is the proposed magnitude amount of $100,000 and $250,000 accurate? Is this the correct amount for the project or a clerical error?           A4. The magnitude is between $100,000 to $250,000. In accordance with FAR 36.204, for construction contracts, we are obligated to state the magnitude of a project using specific price ranges, both in terms of its physical characteristics and estimated price range. However, it's crucial to understand that these price ranges are broad categories and selecting one does not imply that our budget is at the higher end of that range. The intent is to give a general sense of the project's scale without revealing the Government's precise estimate. For instance, if we categorize a project as being ""Between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000,"" it doesn't mean our budget is close to $5,000,000.

Chapter 21 (4) and FAR 3.104-8. It is essential for all potential contractors to be fully aware of and compliant with these regulations.

Upon receipt, the contracting officer or contracting specialist will relay these to the relevant program managers or engineers for feedback.

Private firms must be able to compete for the government’s business on a scrupulously fair basis. Fairness is a pre-requisite of government acquisition due to the government’s unique position as representatives of the citizens of the United States. Government personnel who are associated with the acquisition process have a responsibility to protect its integrity by maintaining fairness in the government’s treatment of all firms.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide ELIGIBLE OFFERORS: United States Citizens SECURITY LEVEL REQUIRED: SECRET STATEMENT OF DUTIES POSITION DESCRIPTION BACKGROUND USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community- based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation. To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as “bullpenners,” providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers’ compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation. OTI’s Core Values: Agility OTI addresses complex political problems through context analysis, experimentation, and strategic resource use. Applying an adaptive mindset in Washington and the field accelerates timely positive change. Political OTI seeks to understand how power is created, traded, and facilitated, requiring that we acknowledge our privilege and the limits of our power. This understanding helps us act on power dynamics and harness them for transformation. Accountability OTI exhibits a sense of ownership and integrity in the work we do, and holds a sense of responsibility to each other, the local partners we engage, the policies and programs we advance with our implementing partners, and the taxpayer. Curiosity OTI’s mission demands learning and adaptation. Our relentless curiosity drives us to wonder about people, problems, and possibilities. We question the status quo, seek to understand amid uncertainty, and treat mistakes as a compass pointing us toward more effective approaches. Diversity & Inclusion OTI’s ability to achieve its mission and live out its values is propelled by our collective responsibility to create a sense of belonging for all in our work environment. OTI values the diversity of each others’ authentic selves, building a foundation of trust and respect. Courage OTI embraces our engagements with one another, our stakeholders, and our programs with intentionality and optimism. Achieving our mission requires that we take risks and tackle difficult conversations and decisions. A courageous OTI is a force for positive change. OTI’s DEIA Vision Statement: OTI is a collaborative environment that represents the global community at all levels of our organization. Uniting diverse backgrounds and experiences, we value individual expertise to advance peace and democracy around the world. Values and associated behaviors that will enable this vision are: Trust Model open communication, active listening and candor. Believe others when they share their experiences. Respect A respectful attitude should be shown to everyone. Allow for others to express complete opinion/thoughts without interruption, while recognizing that there are other perspectives and lived experiences. Belonging (Accessibility) Serve as an ally to those who feel excluded (professionally, socially, personally, etc.). Promote togetherness and acceptance through equitable behavior. Empathy Listen to understand, create space to be real/feel. Remind yourself to be conscious of how others may feel or receive your words Self-awareness/accountability Supervisors hold their peers to account on their expectations and behaviors. Seek regular, constructive feedback to understand how your words and actions affect and influence others, and how they are being perceived and interpreted. Acknowledge unconscious bias and be willing to learn and change behavior when confronted/corrected. For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: https://www.usaid.gov/stabilization-and-transitions INTRODUCTION The Senior Transition Advisor is a member of USAID’s Bureau for Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (CPS)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), and is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas with strong program management, budgetary and operational skills.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA), evaluation method. Technical Acceptability is defined as: Meeting all requirements as defined in the solicitation, to include submission of all quote submission documents referenced in Instructions for the Preparation of Offers (FAR 52.212-1 Addendum). Failure to submit ANY of the required document listed in “Offer Submission Documents (52.212-1 Addendum)” will render your quote non- responsive and thus not eligible for award. Failure to acknowledge any and all amendments will render your quote non-responsive and thus not eligible for award. The rating will be acceptable or Unacceptable. Authorized Vendors and Manufacturers. This requirement will ensure that devices are not counterfeit or adulterated devices, have maintained adequate storage conditions, and any warranties and service and/or maintenance agreements are transferred and will be honored by the offeror. Offerors that are 3rd party or pass through will not be accepted. The rating will be acceptable or Unacceptable. Acceptable rating in “Past Performance”. Past performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2. Past Performance will be rated on an “acceptable” or “unacceptable” basis. The apparent successful, prospective contractor must have “acceptable” past performance. System for Award Management (SAM.gov) exclusions list, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System, and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and CRA / SAM reports shall be considered as part of the past performance evaluation process. Any past performance that is found to be “Negative”, shall result in the entire Past Performance rating as “Unacceptable”. “Negative” is defined as any CPARS and CRA / SAM past performance evaluation rated less than “Satisfactory”, any Terminations for Default/Cause, or any negative performance references will be rated as ‘Unacceptable’. Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, “unknown” shall be considered “acceptable.” Any past performance that is found to be “negative”, shall result in the entire Past Performance rating as “Unacceptable” making the overall Technical Acceptability as “Unacceptable”. The rating will be acceptable or Unacceptable.","Nov 09, 2023 05:00 PM EST","Oct 26, 2023","Oct 26, 2023","Combined Synopsis/Solicitation","Laura Nessa","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","Soybean and Other Oilseed Processing","FORAGE AND FEED","N/A","Total Small Business Set-Aside (FAR 19.5)"

"7200-EE-24-0002","USAID E&E Bureau. Proposed Contract Modification to Task Order # 7200AA21F00012 “Connect for Growth” with Research Triangle Institute (RTI)","C4G Activity Background Information. The purpose of the C4G activity  is to strengthen energy security and resilience in the Europe and Eurasia (E&E) region as part of EI’s U.S.-Europe Energy Bridge project.  Under this activity, the contractor shall provide technical guidance, recommendations, and support for energy market development, regional integration, and reforms; diversified and efficient resource utilization and planning; and resilient energy systems to advance USAID’s goal of increasing connectivity and cooperation in the energy sector between partner countries and the EU. The activity is designed to quickly and effectively respond to emerging issues and technical needs in partner countries impacting the regional energy sector and critical infrastructure.  USAID will coordinate with the contractor to provide energy sector expertise to institutions, such as ministries, regulatory agencies, and utilities, in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Moldova, North Macedonia, Serbia, Ukraine, and other countries for which support will impact regional energy security. The activity has the following objectives: Objective 1: Strengthened governance of domestic and integrated regional energy markets. Objective 2: Reduced dependence on energy sources controlled by malign actors. Objective 3: Improved energy system resilience. Contract Action Description. This action also seeks to increase the Total Estimated Cost (TEC) of the Connect for Growth (C4G) Task Order by $10 million. Increasing funding will allow USAID to continue to deliver and sufficiently plan for its assistance to the E&E region, particularly Moldova, over the next two years to facilitate commercial energy transactions, build the capacity of energy institutions to respond to potential supply disruptions and other threats, and accelerate governance and market structures that undercut Russia’s monopoly influence over the continent’s energy sector.

"12805B24Q0005","413 Steer Calves with Appropriate Genotypic and Phenotypic Traits","THIS NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This Presolicitation notice of intent to issue a sole source award is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This procurement will be processed pursuant to FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. No solicitation will be issued. All responsible sources who believe they can provide the services listed may submit, in writing to the identified point of contact, a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government. Responses are to be received within 5 days of this notice. No telephone calls are being accepted. The United States Department Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis. This procurement is for ARS Plains Area location in Clay Center, Nebraska at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC). Contract type will be a Firm Fixed Price and will be awarded to The University of Nebraska. This is for purchase of 413 male calves that have the appropriate genotypic and phenotypic traits. NAICS Code is 112111. Period of performance is estimated to be 2 months from date of award. For biosecurity reasons, U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) does not allow animals to be brought onto the Center from outside sources. The University of Nebraska has had a long term cooperative relationship with USMARC on the ARS owned property. This relationship is documented in ARS agreement number 58-3040-9-011. The university herd and the ARS herd are both on this property. As a result, the university animals are the only animals that can be supplied to ARS. The U.S. Meat Animal Research center needs 413 steer calves for its research programs in genetics, breeding, meat safety, meat quality, reproduction, nutrition, and environmental management. This policy has been in place for decades and is in place to protect the animal herd that is valued at greater than $12M. This value is strictly a market value. The research value of these herds is many multiples of the market value. These 413 animals provided by the University comply with the necessary biosecurity policies and procedures in place in order to protect that substantial tax payer investment in the animal herds at USMARC. Also, the University has already collected the necessary data to move the above mentioned projects forward. The University and ARS have a close collaboration at USMARC and these animals have the necessary scientific and phenotypic information already collected on them that will allow congressionally funded research projects to move forward. These projects will not be able to move forward without these animals. Please e-mail all inquiries regarding this notice to Amber Sampson at amber.sampson@usda.gov. All inquiries are due no later than October 27, 2023 at 5:00pm MST.","Oct 27, 2023 05:00 PM MDT","Oct 25, 2023","Oct 25, 2023","Presolicitation","Amber Sampson","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","Beef Cattle Ranching and Farming ","LIVE ANIMALS, NOT RAISED FOR FOOD","N/A","N/A"

"12405B24Q0003","Microfluidics Equipment Purchase","Specifications for Microfluidics Equipment Purchase This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 12405B23Q0592 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The NAICS code is 334516 – Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. This solicitation document incorporates those provision and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2023-05 Any quotes not meeting the minimum specifications will not be considered.  The Auxillary Process Module (APM, Product Number L30Z, $7675, Photo 2) sold exclusively by Microfuidics Corporation, a subsidiary of Idex Corporation, is a specially designed, z-configured, 300µm, ceramic-lined, stainless steel chamber which serves to premix biomass streams flowing at 30000 psi and at a rate of 110 mL  per minute as part of a Microfluidizer (M-110P, Photo 1), a particle size reducing apparatus.  The APM is positioned in-line, upstream from a diamond-lined interaction chamber (DXIC, Product Number L10Z, $7675.00, photo 2) where the particle size is further reduced to 150 µm. The DXIC is sold exclusively by Microfuidics Corporation and is similarly z-configured as the APM with an outer stainless-steel housing. Acting in tandem and after multiple passes of biomass, these two chambers are central to the production of nanocellulose fibers. The two photos below of the M-110P microfluidizer and processing line show the APM and the DXIC chambers in a typical setup. The titanium coil of tubing lying within the tray (photo 2) is the area wherein ice is placed to cool the high-pressurized tubing via heat exchange. As part of this purchase order justification, we are asking for an external heat exchanger (Product Number M110PV3, $8245.00) sold exclusively by Microfuidics Corporation to be purchased which will provide a greater level of cooling, without the need to constantly replenish ice and to drain off excessive water.

USAID/LAC is interested in learning what gaps and promising interventions are identified by local and international donors, non-governmental organizations, private sector entities, universities, and think tanks to ensure inclusive and equitable access to quality education, especially for those marginalized and vulnerable groups described (Table 1, above). USAID seeks interested parties’ responses to one or more of the questions that address gaps and promising interventions for one or more of the above groups. USAID also asks that interested parties respond based on the countries and contexts in which they have direct experience and in relation to populations with which they have direct experience. 1. Missing groups: Which, if any, distinct groups, or demographics might have been excluded from (and not necessarily encompassed by) the list of marginalized groups (Table 1) in the LAC region that do not have equitable access to quality education? Please explain. 1. Gaps in access: What promising work have you observed in LAC or other regions to help address gaps in inclusive and equitable access to pre-primary, primary, and secondary education for marginalized and vulnerable groups? 2. Gaps in learning quality: What promising work have you observed to help address gaps in the inclusive and equitable quality (demonstrable learning levels) of pre-primary, primary, and secondary education for marginalized and vulnerable groups? 3. Promising interventions: What positive or promising models of inclusive and equitable education, both in terms of access and quality of education, have you observed in particular schools, communities, and/or countries that might be scaled or replicated? What additional comments do you have regarding promising interventions for addressing gaps in access and quality of education for marginalized and vulnerable groups? 4. Donor landscape: What other (non-USAID) donors, such as multilateral organizations and private or philanthropic foundations, are leading the way in the inclusive and equitable education space? What interesting/promising work are they doing, for what levels of education, and where? 5. Local organizations landscape: What local nonprofit, private, and/or government organizations do you think are doing interesting work in the inclusive and equitable education space? What promising work are they doing? What capacity gaps/needs do local organizations have that might limit the impact of their work? 6. Role of technology: What role should technology play in ensuring inclusive and equitable access to quality education, particularly for marginalized and vulnerable groups? What promising technologies or technological interventions have you seen working in the inclusive and equitable education space? 7. Prioritization: Given limited resources, what gaps/barriers to inclusive and quality education for particular groups would you prioritize and why (please share your criteria for prioritization such as need, easy wins, existing momentum, etc.)? Please be sure to list the context(s)/country(ies) you are referencing in your response.","Oct 29, 2023 04:00 PM EDT","Oct 16, 2023","Oct 16, 2023","Sources Sought","Hannah Weatherford | Sayed Wasim","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","Educational Support Services","EDUCATION (APPLIED/EXPLORATORY)","N/A","Total Small Business Set-Aside (FAR 19.5)"

The SWIFT IDIQ contract is one of USAID/OTI’s tools that enables USAID to seize emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to provide adaptive and agileprogramming in countries or regions. To accomplish this, the SWIFT 6 IDIQ is structured around two service areas/components: 1) Implementation of Transition Programs (SWIFT-Programs); and, 2) Program Operations Technical Assistance Support (SWIFT-Support) - restricted to Small Business Set-Aside. Under the SWIFT-Programs component, the Contractor through specific Task Orders will: a) establish, staff , manage, operate, and support a flexible, quick-response mechanism capable of administering and implementing targeted activities under OTI Country or Regional Programs; b) undertake programmatic research initiatives; and, c) provide support to program-funded USAID personnel.

Task Orders that are issued under this IDIQ will specify: the country or region within which an engagement will occur; the initial objectives of the Task Order statement of work; the specific services anticipated; and illustrative program activities. The SWIFT 6 IDIQ has a ten (10) year ordering period with an additional two- (2) year period of performance for ongoing Task Orders. The unrestricted (SWIFT-Programs) and restricted small-business set-aside (SWIFT-Support) components of the IDIQ will share the overall SWIFT 6 IDIQ ceiling.

This procurement will be processed pursuant to FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. No solicitation will be issued. All responsible sources who believe they can provide the services listed may submit, in writing to the identified point of contact, a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government. Responses are to be received within 5 days of this notice. No telephone calls are being accepted. The United States Department Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis. This procurement is for ARS Plains Area location in Clay Center, Nebraska at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC). Contract type will be a Firm Fixed Price and will be awarded to The University of Nebraska. This is for purchase of 413 male calves that have the appropriate genotypic and phenotypic traits. NAICS Code is 112111. Period of performance is estimated to be 2 months from date of award. For biosecurity reasons, U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) does not allow animals to be brought onto the Center from outside sources. The University of Nebraska has had a long term cooperative relationship with USMARC on the ARS owned property. This relationship is documented in ARS agreement number 58-3040-9-011. The university herd and the ARS herd are both on this property. As a result, the university animals are the only animals that can be supplied to ARS. The U.S. Meat Animal Research center needs 413 steer calves for its research programs in genetics, breeding, meat safety, meat quality, reproduction, nutrition, and environmental management. This policy has been in place for decades and is in place to protect the animal herd that is valued at greater than $12M. This value is strictly a market value. The research value of these herds is many multiples of the market value. These 413 animals provided by the University comply with the necessary biosecurity policies and procedures in place in order to protect that substantial tax payer investment in the animal herds at USMARC. Also, the University has already collected the necessary data to move the above mentioned projects forward. The University and ARS have a close collaboration at USMARC and these animals have the necessary scientific and phenotypic information already collected on them that will allow congressionally funded research projects to move forward. These projects will not be able to move forward without these animals. Please e-mail all inquiries regarding this sources sought notice to Amber Sampson at amber.sampson@usda.gov.

The Authorized Principal Geographic Code for this solicitation is 937 – Default. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. USAID anticipates awarding a single Hybrid - Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Completion - Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract.  The Total Estimated Cost-Plus Fixed Fee for services under this contract (CLIN 001 & CLIN 002) is estimated to fall within the range of $55 million to $60 million.  This procurement will be conducted under Full and Open Competition procedures, pursuant to Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1).  Please refer to Section L for information regarding proposal requirements. Offerors should consider the expected delivery time required by the proposal transmission method they choose, and they are responsible for ensuring proposals are received at USAID by the due date and time as specified in Section L.  Any proposal not received by USAID by the date/time specified in this RFP will not be reviewed or evaluated.  Faxed proposals are not acceptable, nor will they be reviewed or evaluated. Section L of the RFP sets forth all instructions for the preparation and submission of required proposal contents, including critical dates/times for the submission of questions, and the proposal submission closing date and time. Section M states the criteria by which proposals will be evaluated. The competition will utilize a Highest Technical Rated with Fair and Reasonable Price and Realistic Cost (HTR) process, not a tradeoff process. In this process, USAID is concerned with getting the best technical solution that has a fair and reasonable price and realistic cost. Past Performance will not be part of the technical evaluation; it will not be included in the HTR determination process and will be evaluated outside using a pass/neutral/fail approach. Offerors must carefully review Sections L and M of this RFP for details of this process. Oral explanations or instructions given before award of the contract that are not formalized with an amendment will not constitute a formal amendment of the RFP and will not be binding. This RFP in no way obligates USAID to award a contract or task order nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal.  Award of a Contract under this RFP is subject to availability of funds and other internal USAID approvals. USAID expects that Offerors will have equal access to all local organizations needed to implement this contract and strongly discourages exclusivity agreements with local organizations.

"JA-23-062","CLASS JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&A) FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION COVERING PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS WITH COOPERATING COUNTRY NATIONALS","This document is a class justification and approval (J&A) for other than full and open competition for awards of personal services contracts (PSCs) with cooperating country nationals (CCNs), issued under the authority of section 113 of title 40, United States Code (U.S.C.), as applied by USAID pursuant to section 706.302-70 of title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 7, the USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR).   Under the authority of 40 U.S.C. 113(e)(2), AIDAR 706.302-70(a)(2) states that full and open competition need not be obtained when it would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purposes of foreign aid, relief, and rehabilitation. AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1) authorizes the use of this authority for an award under section 636(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, involving a personal services contractor serving abroad. USAID’s ability to recruit and retain the best talent in partner countries depends on the Agency supporting and investing in its local workforce. CCNPSCs are critical to USAID’s global mission for many reasons, including their local leadership, technical expertise, and country-specific knowledge and insights that inform and enable the Agency’s ability to solve complex development challenges. Through these exceptions to competition, USAID will be able to provide intangible benefits for its CCNPSCs beyond what each post LCP provides, in the form of improved career growth, professional advancement, and job security. If USAID is unable to provide these intangible benefits, it is at greater risk of losing highly qualified and experienced staff to other entities that compete for talent in the foreign assistance sector, and who are able to offer higher salaries. Without use of the authority for other than full and open competition as described in this class J&A, the Agency would be impaired in its ability to recruit and retain the CCNPSCs necessary to carry out foreign aid programs in the host countries where it operates. During the course of the performance of their contracts, CCNPSCs gain critical knowledge of USAID programming and processes. This class justification preserves USAID’s ability to meet its obligations as a foreign affairs agency by retaining its critical CCNPSC workforce and removing impediments to their ability to continue successfully performing.   The Agency has a longstanding practice of limiting competition for CCNPSC awards to the local marketplace. Through a series of class J&As since the 1990s, the Agency has relieved COs of the administrative burden of preparing separate justifications to limit competition to the CCN community for local national PSC staffing opportunities. USAID issued a class J&A for CCNPSCs in its Contractor Information Bulletin (CIB) 92-5, preceding the publication of AIDAR Appendix J in 1993. Subsequently, CIB 97-16 was issued on July 10,1997 to supersede the CIB 92-5 class J&A. Use of the authority to limit competition for CCNPSCs was renewed on December 20, 2016 by a class J&A that was incorporated into Agency policy (Automated Directives System (ADS), Chapter 309 and Mandatory Reference 309mad). This revised class J&A conforms to the requirements in FAR 6.303-2. It supersedes the last above-referenced class J&A and provides for expanded application of the 40 U.S.C. 113 authority beyond what was previously authorized.","N/A","Oct 12, 2023","Oct 12, 2023","Justification","J&A Mailbox","Active","N/A","JA-23-062","Oct 10, 2023","All Other Personal Services","SUPPORT- PROFESSIONAL: PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS","N/A","N/A"

ELIGIBLE OFFERORS: U.S. Citizens 10. SECURITY LEVEL REQUIRED: USG Secret Clearance 11. STATEMENT OF DUTIES BACKGROUND: USAID/Mozambique manages one of USAID's largest country programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Its employees are organized into offices implementing programs in health, democracy and governance, agriculture, environment, economic growth, and education. Mozambique is considered important to U.S. foreign policy interests on the continent.  In addition to USAID, United States Government (USG) programs in Mozambique are supported across multiple agencies, including Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Department of State, Department of Defense, and Peace Corps.  The scope and innovation of USAID and USG’s program in Mozambique attracts numerous VIP visits and attention, therefore, USAID programs are subject to intense scrutiny by various elements of the US government, by Mozambican government ministries, and by diverse civil society constituencies. USAID/Mozambique’s IHO, with approximately 80 staff, manages one of USAID’S largest health country programs in sub-Saharan Africa, with a total FY 2023 operating budget of approximately $330 million. A key objective of the U.S. Mission in Mozambique is to support the Government of Mozambique (GOM)  in achieving Millennium Development Goals and other health objectives by reducing maternal and child mortality through an integrated package of primary health care services, supporting voluntary use of family planning, supporting treatment expansion for and prevention of HIV/AIDS, improving access to TB treatment services, preventing and treating malaria, and supporting the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). To respond to these numerous objectives, USAID/Mozambique’s IHO receives and manages funding for multiple presidential initiatives and priority health interventions, including the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), and Feed the Future. Mozambique is a Global Health Initiative Country and focuses on ending preventable child and maternal death (EPCMD) and health systems strengthening.  Improving the collection, analysis, reporting, and use of data linked to the various health interventions is integral to the USG and Mozambique’s Ministry of Health (MOH) in achieving these objectives. BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION The Senior Strategic Information Advisor and Team Leader will serve both the USAID IHO and the USG interagency PEPFAR team by providing technical leadership and assistance to plan, initiate, conduct, evaluate, and coordinate complex health programs in the area of monitoring and evaluation, surveillance, and as necessary, applied evaluation research, to monitor program implementation, document results, and translate data into meaningful policy and program improvement.  The incumbent will play a key role for the USG in developing and enhancing knowledge management systems, data dissemination practices and uses, and expanding USG Mozambique’s capacity to utilize various forms of data to inform and drive implementing partner programs. As a member of the Interagency Strategic Information (SI) Monitoring and Evaluation Team, the incumbent will provide leadership in this field and will supervise seven USAID staff members who are also members of the interagency SI Team, as well as mentor other staff members who are responsible for overseeing USG-funded HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs.  As HIV programs are integrated with other health activities, the Senior Strategic Information Advisor and Team Leader will also have responsibility for monitoring and evaluation across the entire health portfolio, including maternal and child health, reproductive health and family planning, and malaria and tuberculosis, in addition to HIV/AIDS.

As appropriate, USAID/Zimbabwe will incorporate responses to this RFI into the development of future activity designs that may lead to a formal solicitation or announcement; however, USAID/Zimbabwe is not obligated to do so. This RFI is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 and FAR 15.201(e). This information will be used to help make planning decisions and influence activity design to improve future development outcomes. Background The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) acknowledges that the private sector is an engine for growth, creating nine out of ten jobs in the developing world. As a result, the Agency intends to identify a shared vision of what can be achieved together with private sector partners to build a partnership that taps into our respective strengths, including addressing many of the obstacles that businesses face – from supply chain stability to community investment and workforce development. Therefore, USAID is implementing a private sector collaboration pathway that will use business models and market forces to address development and humanitarian challenges more sustainably and/or at scale that will enable low-income people, including smallholder farmers in the agroecological region IV and V, and vulnerable communities around protected areas within the USAID/Zimbabwe’s Resilience Focus Zone (see attached concept notes), to have access to improved quality products and services that they can afford. If this market-based solution becomes commercially viable, the private sector will have a financial incentive to continue to operate it at scale without further U.S. government support. The end goal will be that this partnership will empower the private sector partners to attain their core business interests while USAID achieves its development objectives.","Aug 28, 2023 05:00 PM CEST","Oct 11, 2023","Oct 11, 2023","Presolicitation","Relax Moyo | Solomon Chang","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES","N/A","N/A"

"72067424RFI00001","EMPOWER NIGERIA - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) No. 72067424RFI00001","Empower Nigeria - Program Information Development Problem: Over 200 million people live in Nigeria and its population is projected to be the third most populous country in the world by 2050. The World Bank indicates that 85 million Nigerians (43 percent of the population) don’t have access to electricity, making Nigeria the country with the largest electricity access deficit in sub-Saharan Africa. Even for those that have access to electricity, the reliability and quality of supply is low, resulting in an estimated economic loss of $26 billion annually according to the World Bank[1]. To help address the low level of reliability and quality of supply, businesses and residents have invested in a range of small to medium scale fossil fuel generators with a combined capacity that dwarfs the country’s installed on-grid generation capacity[2]. This self generation with fossil fuel has increased greenhouse gas emissions and resulted in a higher cost of electricity. While efforts have been made to increase access through several initiatives, programs, and the promotion of clean technologies, the triple challenge of providing reliable and high quality electricity supply, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and providing affordable electricity supply to consumers, still persist. These challenges have constrained sustainable development of the country affecting critical sectors of the economy: industrialization, health care, education, agriculture/food security, and economic opportunities. Purpose of Program: The purpose of the Empower Nigeria program is to increase the availability of and access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern[3] electricity services in Nigeria. This program will connect more Nigerian homes, businesses, and institutions to electricity on the grid and beyond the grid; reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector by supporting cleaner electricity generation delivered by the grid and accelerating distributed renewable energy (DRE); and, working in partnership with the Government of Nigeria and other institutions to improve the enabling environment for energy sector investment (including climate finance) and innovation. More concretely, Empower Nigeria will seek  to advance the following objectives in Nigeria: Ongrid Sector: To Improve the financial sustainability and flow of energy through the national electricity grid through targeted interventions in the distribution sector and to a secondary degree transmission systems to achieve the following end-state: The majority of Nigerian distribution companies achieve positive cash flows, due to a combination of increasing residential, commercial and industrial sales of energy (MWh), declining ATC&C losses and other turnaround efforts; The Nigerian grid’s peak load regularly exceeds 7,000 MW; 500 MW of grid scale-connected solar reaches financial close (distribution/transmission level including embedded generation); and Discos expand use of demand side management. Given the binding constraint presented by the distribution sector’s insolvency and limited capacity, as well as the transmission sector’s capacity constraints, USAID/Power Africa envisages that Empower Nigeria’s on-grid interventions will focus initially on distribution and transmission, with generation interventions occurring more opportunistically in response to demand shifts. Off-grid: The off-grid sector expands and matures, particularly in peri-urban, rural zones and other areas with limited access to the national grid. Success over the life of the program would be the achievement of the following end-state: 500 mini-grids are commissioned and operating profitably; 2 million off-grid connections established; Increased usage of off-grid systems for productive use; Off-grid companies achieve profitability despite declining subsidies; and Increased availability of international/domestic equity and domestic bank financing for off-grid companies.

The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor’s input resulting from this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI may be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for future needs. The information provided may be utilized by the US Forest Service in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Objective, Statement of Work, and/or Performance Specifications. The information resulting from this RFI may be included or combined with other submissions in one or more options considered in the analysis of alternatives. Any proprietary information that is submitted may be used in establishing requirements of the future system but specific information will be safeguarded as proprietary. The purpose of this announcement is to obtain market research associated with Exclusive-Use (EU) helicopter services to support US Forest Service (USFS) Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data collection fieldwork in Alaska.  Specifically, the USFS is seeking 1 or more interested vendors capable of providing helicopter services for passenger transport for the PNWRS FIA program that meet the specifications described herein. USFS seeks helicopter services for passenger transport, fully operated by qualified and proficient personnel, and equipped in accordance with any applicable regulations and the terms and conditions contained in a contract resulting from solicitation of services. Interested vendors should outline within their response their experience in providing helicopter services of the type specified, particularly with regard to experience operating in remote areas, utilizing unimproved landing zones, and extreme environmental conditions similar to those found in Interior Alaska.  One or more contracts may result from eventual solicitation of services. Individual or multiple item(s) may be awarded to separate firms, or a single award may be made covering all items. Partner firms intending to provide services jointly will be required to submit a subcontracting or partnering plan as part of their bid package in order to demonstrate how the entities will operate in tandem to meet project requirements. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND LOCATIONS The US Forest Service (USFS), Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) is tasked with annual data acquisition for inventory and monitoring of Alaska’s forests. The USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program conducts our nation’s forest inventory effort aimed at monitoring the status and trends of forested lands in the US through a network of permanent field “plots” installed on the ground (Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program).  In Alaska, the inventory is divided into two units: Coastal Alaska and Interior Alaska. This request covers the Interior Alaska inventory unit, which comprises most of the area north and west of Prince William Sound and the Kenai Peninsula, including the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands (and excluding Kodiak Island, fig 1).  This request for information is related to a possible change in the Interior Alaska FIA study design; if a change in study design is determined to be in the best interest of the Government (based in part on information gained from this request), work with the resources described in this request would not begin before May of 2026. Annual project work occurs primarily during the months of May through September.  We anticipate that this project will utilize multiple aircraft concurrently from unique bases of operation (“hubs”) distributed throughout the Interior Alaska FIA project area. Field plots are distributed approximately 20-30 miles apart across all forested lands. Hubs will be strategically selected to provide the resources required for a project base of operations and so that flights to plots will generally be less than 100-nautical miles from each hub. Aircraft fueling will occur at these hubs utilizing Fixed Base Operators (FBOs) where available, or remote fueling setups installed by the Government and certified by the Department of Interior (DOI). Vendors are not responsible for fuel logistics and will be operating under dry flight rates for this contract. For the purpose of this request, Anchorage or Fairbanks, Alaska, should be used as the Host Base. Project work across other hub locations in the state will qualify as travel away from the Host Base and thus any required vendor personnel would be entitled to Remain Over Night (RON) allowances unless such services (food, lodging, ground transportation) are being provided to vendor personnel by the Government. The vendor pilot and aircraft will remain at their designated field hub(s) throughout the Mandatory Availability Period (MAP). The pilot will likely be utilizing the same accommodations as field crews, which may include rustic field camps, hotels, or remote lodges. It is important that vendors be familiar with maintaining multiple aircraft operating in remote locations, and that vendor personnel are comfortable working and living with field crews in remote parts of Alaska with minimal services available. NOTE: Figure 1 is included in PDF file titled (INTAK Annualized Inventory Request for Information) REQUIREMENTS The intent of this request is to determine market capacity and cost estimates for aviation support of the Interior Alaska inventory. The USFS is interested in obtaining information to help determine logistical considerations for project operations under two different scenarios: Scenario A: Three (3) helicopters will support the project, moving between hubs as needed. Under this scenario, each helicopter will have a 94-day Mandatory Availability Period (MAP) and 219 estimated flight hours. A typical day will see one 3-person crew and one 2-person crew fly to two different sites on two separate flights. Actual payload (passengers + internal cargo) for a 3-person crew is 725lbs. Scenario B: Five (5) helicopters will support the project, moving between hubs as needed. Under this scenario, each helicopter will have a 90-day MAP and 102 estimated flight hours. A typical day will see one 2-person crew fly to one site. Actual payload (passengers + internal cargo) for a 2-person crew is 515lbs. Under either scenario, an optional use period of up to 10 days may be exercised with mutual agreement between the Contractor and the Government. Availability During each Mandatory Availability Period (MAP) each helicopter(s) shall be made available for the exclusive use of the Government. Availability is required 14 hours per day, generally between 0700 and 2100. Personnel Each aircraft shall be staffed 7 days/week throughout the MAP with a qualified pilot. A single helicopter mechanic will be required to be on duty during any helicopter MAP, available to assist with routine or unscheduled maintenance as needed. To best support multiple helicopters in this capacity, the mechanic may remain at the Host Base in Anchorage or Fairbanks, AK, with the capability to travel to the various remote hubs where helicopters are operating, as needed. Contractor may select appropriate personnel schedules to ensure aircraft availability. Relief crew costs shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. Mission Profiles Typical mission profiles will include passenger transport with internal cargo to and from remote, unimproved landing zones. Pilots must be comfortable operating out of unimproved landing areas utilizing maximum performance takeoffs and landings, in confined spaces, with uneven HOGE surface conditions, during periods of inclement weather, gusty winds, and smoky conditions. Vendors and pilots must be comfortable shutting down aircraft in the field on a daily basis while  the Government completes project work. The use of qualified pilots with experience operating under conditions and terrain similar to those in Alaska is required to safely provide adequate performance under a variety of hazardous conditions. Internal Cargo Required payloads for each proposed project scenario are identified above. These payloads include passenger weights plus a 60L backpack per passenger, one 15L dry bag, one shotgun (38” long), one field equipment bag (24”x12”x12”), one metal soil probe (42” long), and one ammo can (11”x4”x7”). Aircraft Equipment Integrated satellite phone Tundra pads High skid gear Programmable VHF-FM radio First aid and survival kit (~25lb) Some missions may require operations beyond gliding distance from shore which will require additional equipment to meet contract specifications. The USFS does not anticipate a need for multiple aircraft to meet the configuration standards for flights operating beyond gliding distance from shore. Consider these specifications in your response, as indicated in the Aviation Information section, below. REQUESTED INFORMATION *USFS is interested in identifying vendors who have experience operating and maintaining rotor wing aircraft in remote, mountainous environments with frequent poor weather events during the operating season, similar to those found across Alaska, with qualified personnel comfortable with maximum performance takeoffs and landings from unimproved landing zones in confined spaces, and capable of providing professional services while living and working in sometimes austere conditions.* Company Information Company name Company mailing address Company point of contact (name & title) Point of contact's telephone numbers and email address Aviation Information: Company name (if different from above) Operational experience and capacity Describe or include documentation of your company experience with rotor wing operations supporting Government projects, based from field camps or remote lodge while providing for routine and unscheduled aircraft maintenance. Describe pilot experience operating in conditions similar to those described above.

SECURITY LEVEL REQUIRED: Secret POSITION DESCRIPTION   BACKGROUND USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation. To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers’ compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI in the forthcoming solicitation. INTRODUCTION The Senior Transition Advisor is a member of USAID’s Bureau for Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (CPS)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), and is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas with strong program management, budgetary and operational skills. The Senior Transition Advisor is an intermittent and senior-level position in support of OTI’s numerous field programs, including ad hoc support for assessments, country start-ups, program implementation and close-outs. You are involved in the strategic design of OTI country programs, the development of management products based on lessons learned, and will support the training and mentoring of field and DC-based staff. The complex demands of this position requires overseas travel with short notice, and the ability to respond to immediate and challenging managerial, operational, and security issues. You must be prepared to work and collaborate with senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, and non-governmental organizations important to OTI’s programs and objectives, with an in-depth knowledge of international relations. BASIS OF RATING:  Offerors who clearly meet the Education/Experience Requirements and Selection Factors set forth in the coming solicitation will be further evaluated based on scoring of the Evaluation Factor responses. Offerors who meet these minimum qualifications will be reviewed against set Evaluation Factors, describing specifically and accurately what experience, training, education and/or awards they have received that are relevant to each factor. Failure to specifically address the Selection and/or Evaluation Factors may result in your not receiving credit for all of your pertinent experience, education, training and/or awards.  The most qualified offerors may be interviewed, required to provide a writing sample, and demonstrate an ability to operate commonly used office applications. OTI will not pay for any expenses associated with the interviews. In addition, offers (written materials and interviews) will be evaluated based on content as well as on the offerors writing, presentation, and communication skills. In the event that an offeror has fully demonstrated their qualifications and there are no other competitive offerors, OTI reserves the right to forgo the interview process. Professional references and academic credentials will be evaluated for offerors being considered for selection. Offerors must submit at least three (3) professional references, one (1) of which must be a current or former supervisor. OTI reserves the right to contact previous employers to verify employment history.  If the offeror had a previous position with USAID, the TEC and/or CO are encouraged to obtain reference checks from the previous supervisor(s) or CO(s). See ADS 309.3.1.11.a.4 The Government may award a contract without discussions with offerors in accordance with FAR 52.215-1. The CO reserves the right at any point in the evaluation process to establish a competitive range of offerors with whom negotiations will be conducted pursuant to FAR 15.306(c). In accordance with FAR 52.215-1, if the CO determines that the number of offers that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the CO may limit the number of offerors in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated offers.

"12445524Q0002","Region 9 A-E Short Selection List Announcement","The purpose of this announcement is to request updated and new Architect-Engineer (AE) qualification information for the USDA Forest Service Eastern Region, AE Short Selection List.   This is an annual reminder, intended to occur at the beginning of each fiscal year (Fiscal years run October 1 through September 30). WHAT IS THE SHORT SELECTION LIST USED FOR? The Forest Service utilizes the Short Selection List to award AE contracts, valued at less than the simplified acquisition threshold, in all states within the Forest Service East Zone Region 9 including the States of, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Although the primary user of the list will be the Forest Service, any USDA office located in the Forest Service East Zone Region 9 boundaries may use the list.  The Shortlist will contain all of the unexpired submissions from previous announcements and all qualified, interested AE firms that respond to this announcement.  Examples of the types of work that may be awarded using the short selection list include: bridge and large culvert design, road and trail bridge inspections, culvert inspections, low volume road design, design of small warehouses and offices, historic preservation, rehabs to improve energy efficiency and safety concerns, energy audits and studies, design of repairs to small dams and impoundments, design of photovoltaic and other renewable energy systems, LEED consulting, design of HVAC systems, design of electrical systems and lighting, water and waste water system design, performance of sanitary inspections for water systems, safety inspections for bridges and dams, construction inspection, drafting services, surveying (construction and property), geotechnical investigation, and environmental (RCRA, CECRLA, CWA, etc.) investigations, reviews, inventories, audits and coordination of RCRA and other waste disposal.

The Short Selection Process utilizes the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.602-5.  For AE projects with an estimated total fee less than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000; see FAR Part 2.101), agencies may use current data files of eligible AE firms to perform technical evaluations and choose the best qualified firm for award. AE data files will be maintained by State and NAICS code. The AE's professional qualifications (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1)) and the firm's geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE's SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of qualified firms exist. Once the most qualified firms are chosen from the AE Shortlist, discussions will be held with those firms. Additional information may be requested during discussions if necessary to facilitate the final ranking of firms (ie: past performance references, specialized experience, capacity, etc.). Upon conclusion of discussions, the top three firms will be ranked, and a price proposal will be requested from the highest ranked firm. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated with the highest ranked firm, a request for price proposal will be sent to the second ranked firm, and so on until an award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.     All acquisitions utilizing the Short Selection List shall be set-aside for small business concerns unless requirements cannot be met by a small business and the Contracting Officer obtains a proper waiver.

"USDAAMSPEANUTCOMPLIANCESEPT2023","Peanut Compliance Services for USDA, AMS","Peanut Compliance Services Background: Peanuts in the United States are produced and marketed with the support of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies including the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA), as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Several State and private agencies assist locally throughout various parts of the marketing chain.  The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (Farm Bill) requires all peanuts marketed in the United States to be inspected and graded by Federal or Federal-State inspectors.  Imported peanuts are subject to the same quality and handling standards as domestically produced peanuts.  As provided under the Farm Bill, the Peanut Standards Board (Board), which is comprised of peanut industry members, consults with USDA on the establishment and revision of peanut standards.  The Standards regulate both the incoming quality of farmers’ stock peanuts and the outgoing quality of peanuts prepared for human consumption.  The Standards are applicable to all peanuts produced in or imported into the United States.  Grading for quality are performed by Federal or State inspectors authorized by AMS Specialty Crops Inspection Division.  Each lot is identified and is tracked through the entire marketing chain. In addition to grading for quality each lot of peanuts is also required to be laboratory tested and do not exceed the limit for Aflatoxin. Aflatoxin testing and certification is performed by laboratories authorized by AMS’s Science and Technology Program.  Working closely with the AMS Specialty Crops Program Market Development Division (MDD), which oversees the Peanut Standards Program, the contractor verifies compliance with the Standards through routine visits to handler facilities and reviews of inspection and certification documentation.   The contractor prepares and forwards case referrals regarding violations to MDD for enforcement action.  Scope of Services: The USDA’s, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) contracts compliance activities for peanuts for human consumption with a firm with experience and knowledge of the peanut industry.  The compliance firm performs audits by assessing handler processes and documentation and conducts cross-collaboration with USDA inspection services and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The food safety joint effort ensures each peanut lot maintains Positive Lot Identification (PLI) throughout the marketing chain. The contractor’s primary responsibility is to verify handler and importer compliance with the established peanut quality and handling standards.  AMS provides program oversight and requires the services of a private contractor for verification of compliance with the Standards (7 CFR part 996).  The contractor will be responsible for performing the required duties as listed below. The contractor must be able to obtain proof in the form of documentation from the peanut handler that supports the final disposition of failing and remilled lots.  The contractor is not responsible for monitoring all incoming inspection results, but only those lots that are considered non-edible, including adequate documentation to the contractor that supports the non-edible lots were properly disposed.    The compliance efforts focus on ensuring that failing and non-edible quality grades of peanuts do not enter the human consumption marketing chain.  Routine surveillance of shelling plants, blanchers, and crushers is a necessary component of the compliance program.  The frequency of visits to handler facilities depends upon the size of the operation and its activities.  Regular communications between the inspectors and the contractor is essential in monitoring the activities at different handler operations.    The contractor is responsible for investigating all complaints of alleged violations.  The contractor must maintain an internal record keeping system of complaints received and follow-up actions taken.  The contractor must report all violation cases to AMS, even if the handler or importer took corrective action.   Interested parties who believe they can meet the capabilities and performance requirements outlined are requested to respond to this Sources Sought Notice by INSERT DAY/DATE/TIME Central Time to Matthew Phillips (matthew.phillips3@usda.gov), with the information outlined below: 1.        Company Information: -        Name of firm, -        Point of contact (name, phone number, and email address), -        SAM.gov UEI number, -        Business Size (Large/Small) for NAICS 541690 (Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, Size Standard is $19.0 million), -        Socioeconomic Category(ies) (8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB), 2.      Capabilities Narrative: -        Please indicate if you are seeking opportunities for peanut compliance services. -        Are you interested in these opportunities as a prime contractor, or a Contractor Teaming Arrangement (CTA)? -        Provide information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) with peanut compliance services or services of a similar nature (scientific and technical consultation services).  Include information such as geographical area, brief description of services performed, dollar value, location, government or commercial requirement, etc. to facilitate making a capability determination for each future requirement. -        Indicate your experience or approach to assimilating into new markets (geographical areas), including recruiting for staffing and subcontractor needs. 3.      Additional Information: -        Please include any other information and/or recommendations to assist USDA in its structuring of these contract requirements to facilitate competition, its approach to acquiring the services and the manner in which requirements are described for the identified items/services.

STATEMENT OF DUTIES POSITION DESCRIPTION BACKGROUND USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation. To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives.There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers’ compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation. OTI’s Core Values: Agility OTI addresses complex political problems through context analysis, experimentation, and strategic resource use. Applying an adaptive mindset in Washington and the field accelerates timely positive change. Political OTI seeks to understand how power is created, traded, and facilitated, requiring that we acknowledge our privilege and the limits of our power. This understanding helps us act on power dynamics and harness them for transformation. Accountability OTI exhibits a sense of ownership and integrity in the work we do, and holds a sense of responsibility to each other, the local partners we engage, the policies and programs we advance with our implementing partners, and the taxpayer. Curiosity OTI’s mission demands learning and adaptation. Our relentless curiosity drives us to wonder about people, problems, and possibilities. We question the status quo, seek to understand amid uncertainty, and treat mistakes as a compass pointing us toward more effective approaches. Diversity & Inclusion OTI’s ability to achieve its mission and live out its values is propelled by our collective responsibility to create a sense of belonging for all in our work environment. OTI values the diversity of each others’ authentic selves, building a foundation of trust and respect. Courage OTI embraces our engagements with one another, our stakeholders, and our programs with intentionality and optimism. Achieving our mission requires that we take risks and tackle difficult conversations and decisions. A courageous OTI is a force for positive change. OTI’s DEIA Vision Statement: OTI is a collaborative environment that represents the global community at all levels of our organization. Uniting diverse backgrounds and experiences, we value individual expertise to advance peace and democracy around the world.  Values and associated behaviors that will enable this vision are:   Trust Model open communication, active listening and candor. Believe others when they share their experiences. Respect A respectful attitude should be shown to everyone. Allow for others to express complete opinion/thoughts without interruption, while recognizing that there are other perspectives and lived experiences.  Belonging (Accessibility) Serve as an ally to those who feel excluded (professionally, socially, personally, etc.). Promote togetherness and acceptance through equitable behavior. Empathy Listen to understand, create space to be real/feel. Remind yourself to be conscious of how others may feel or receive your words Self-awareness/accountability Supervisors hold their peers to account on their expectations and behaviors. Seek regular, constructive feedback to understand how your words and actions affect and influence others, and how they are being perceived and interpreted. Acknowledge unconscious bias and be willing to learn and change behavior when confronted/corrected. For more information about OTI and its country programs please see:  https://www.usaid.gov/stabilization-and-transitions INTRODUCTION The OTI Deputy Country Representative – Burma is a member of the Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (CPS)/OTI Asia Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Country Representative in Burma.

STATEMENT OF DUTIES POSITION DESCRIPTION BACKGROUND USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation. To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers’ compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation. OTI’s Core Values: Agility OTI addresses complex political problems through context analysis, experimentation, and strategic resource use. Applying an adaptive mindset in Washington and the field accelerates timely positive change.   Political OTI seeks to understand how power is created, traded, and facilitated, requiring that we acknowledge our privilege and the limits of our power. This understanding helps us act on power dynamics and harness them for transformation. Accountability OTI exhibits a sense of ownership and integrity in the work we do, and holds a sense of responsibility to each other, the local partners we engage, the policies and programs we advance with our implementing partners, and the taxpayer. Curiosity OTI’s mission demands learning and adaptation. Our relentless curiosity drives us to wonder about people, problems, and possibilities. We question the status quo, seek to understand amid uncertainty, and treat mistakes as a compass pointing us toward more effective approaches. Diversity & Inclusion OTI’s ability to achieve its mission and live out its values is propelled by our collective responsibility to create a sense of belonging for all in our work environment. OTI values the diversity of each others’ authentic selves, building a foundation of trust and respect. Courage OTI embraces our engagements with one another, our stakeholders, and our programs with intentionality and optimism. Achieving our mission requires that we take risks and tackle difficult conversations and decisions. A courageous OTI is a force for positive change. OTI’s DEIA Vision Statement: OTI is a collaborative environment that represents the global community at all levels of our organization. Uniting diverse backgrounds and experiences, we value individual expertise to advance peace and democracy around the world.  Values and associated behaviors that will enable this vision are:   Trust Model open communication, active listening and candor. Believe others when they share their experiences. Respect A respectful attitude should be shown to everyone. Allow for others to express complete opinion/thoughts without interruption, while recognizing that there are other perspectives and lived experiences.  Belonging (Accessibility) Serve as an ally to those who feel excluded (professionally, socially, personally, etc.). Promote togetherness and acceptance through equitable behavior. Empathy Listen to understand, create space to be real/feel. Remind yourself to be conscious of how others may feel or receive your words Self-awareness/accountability Supervisors hold their peers to account on their expectations and behaviors. Seek regular, constructive feedback to understand how your words and actions affect and influence others, and how they are being perceived and interpreted. Acknowledge unconscious bias and be willing to learn and change behavior when confronted/corrected.

Inadequate systems are one of the areas impeding Kenya’s inclusive growth and self-reliance. Key health systems, especially health information systems remain vertical and this continues to pose a threat to more comprehensive and accurate reporting.  The Government of Kenya (GOK) recognizes the vital role played by information systems in measuring the performance of healthcare delivery and generating data to support program monitoring, planning and evaluation. Therefore, GOK has identified and prioritized Information and Communications Technology (ICT) as a key enabler towards the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Over the last decade, GOK and its development partners have made significant investments in the use of technology to improve the access and quality of healthcare delivered to Kenyans. Such investments are manifest in the various Health Information Systems (HIS) deployed across the country, including Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems; Laboratory Information Systems (LIS); Logistics Management Information Systems (LMIS); the Kenya Health Information System (KHIS); the Kenya Master Health Facility List (KMHFL); the Kenya Health and Research Observatory (KHRO); among others.

This capability does not necessarily preclude the use of compatible programming languages, libraries, services, and tools from other sources. The Government may or may not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but does have control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.  MRP IT will need to deploy all forms to ensure documents were designed and updated to include all identified components. This practice serves as a test to ensure each of the documents conform to the MRP IT Forms Management directives and the USDA 508 guidelines.

"72051423R00005","Sustainable Economic Transformation (SET) Activity","Dear Prospective Offerors: The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Colombia, is seeking proposals from U.S. or non-U.S., non-profit or for-profit organizations, to provide services to support sustainable economic opportunities and investment in a targeted geography to foster equitable and environmentally sustainable growth, development, and peace implementation, as outlined in the Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) and as described in the attached Request for Proposals (RFP). The Authorized Principal Geographic Code for this solicitation is 937 – Default. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 541690 – Economic Consulting Services. USAID anticipates awarding a single Hybrid - Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Completion - Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract.  The Total Estimated Cost-Plus Fixed Fee for services under this contract (CLIN 001 & CLIN 002) is estimated to fall within the range of $55.5 million and $58.5 million.  This procurement will be conducted under Full and Open Competition procedures, pursuant to Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1).  Please refer to Section L for information regarding proposal requirements. Offerors should consider the expected delivery time required by the proposal transmission method they choose, and they are responsible for ensuring proposals are received at USAID by the due date and time as specified in Section L.  Any proposal not received by USAID by the date/time specified in this RFP will not be reviewed or evaluated.  Faxed proposals are not acceptable, nor will they be reviewed or evaluated. Section L of the RFP sets forth all instructions for the preparation and submission of required proposal contents, including critical dates/times for the submission of questions, and the proposal submission closing date and time. Section M states the criteria by which proposals will be evaluated. The competition will utilize a Highest Technical Rated with Fair and Reasonable Price and Realistic Cost (HTR) process, not a tradeoff process. In this process, USAID is concerned with getting the best technical solution that has a fair and reasonable price and realistic cost. Past Performance will not be part of the technical evaluation; it will not be included in the HTR determination process and will be evaluated outside using a pass/neutral/fail approach. Offerors must carefully review Sections L and M of this RFP for details of this process. Oral explanations or instructions given before award of the contract that are not formalized with an amendment will not constitute a formal amendment of the RFP and will not be binding. This RFP in no way obligates USAID to award a contract or task order nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal.  Award of a Contract under this RFP is subject to availability of funds and other internal USAID approvals. USAID expects that Offerors will have equal access to all local organizations needed to implement this contract and strongly discourages exclusivity agreements with local organizations. This RFP can be viewed and downloaded from www.sam.gov.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same website from which you downloaded the solicitation.  USAID advises to regularly check the above website for amendments.

This PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS NOTICE is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

Release of an official solicitation is anticipated to occur in August 2023. Interested parties are encouraged to monitor https://sam.gov/content/home for the release of the solicitation. The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) anticipates issuing a request for quote (RFQ), 1202SA23Q9809, to acquire consulting services to review the USFS smokejumper program. The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) made the determination to convert from the mix of round parachutes and Ram-Air parachutes, in its smokejumper program, to one that consists solely of Ram-Air parachutes. In December 2011 and updated in 2015, the USFS adopted a Change Management and Implementation Guide. The USFS completed a Change Management and Implementation Plan (V3) to guide this transition from the round parachute system to exclusive use of the USFS Ram-Air parachute system. The objective of these services is to complete an external review, analysis, and evaluation of the USFS Smokejumper Program’s change management and transition processes for the Ram-Air parachute transition and the current state of the program in the Ram-Air parachute transition to ensure future operational success. The Safety Management Systems (SMS) approach shall be utilized throughout the review, analysis, evaluation, and recommendation(s) of work performed under this purchase order. In addition, this purchase order is intended to obtain contractor services to provide coordination and communication with smokejumer participants; participate in meetings and document issues, take meeting minutes, and review status of the program; attend meetings/conference calls to provide technical analysis and consultation on program issues; review reports from meetings and provide an analysis on reports; travel to designated locations to observe and interview smokejumpers; distribute write-ups (e.g., reports, meeting minutes, technical data); and foster communication and sharing among the smokejumer program. Solicitation 1202SA23Q9809 will be competed as a total small business set-aside. The Government reserves the right to award with or without discussions.

AMENDMENT (A02): The purpose of this amendment is to extend quote due date, update Terms & Conditions (FAR 52.212-1 & 52.212-4) and provide further clarification/instructions on CWN MFSUs.      This combined synopsis/solicitation document is the only attachment for this amendment, al       other solicitation documents remain unchanged. Update Terms & Conditions – AGAR Provision 452.222-71 Past Performance Labor Law Violations (addendum to FAR 52.12-1) and AGAR Clause 452.222-70 Labor Law Violations (addendum to FAR 52.212-4) have been rescinded. These changes will be reflected in subsequent awards. Quote Due Date & Time – Extended to 5/2/2022 @ 5p MDT. Clarifications – Exhibit 12. CWN MFSU Description & Equipment Requirements Checklist- Inspections – Before a certificate of compliance is issued authorizing performance on a BPA, a site inspection may be conducted either in-person or via other electronic methods to determine the unit is suitable for award. Further, photos are necessary to support this exhibit for evaluation purposes. Geographic Area Coordination Center (GACC) – Dispatch center for Regional/Local incidents (< 150 meals). Have access to NICC Source List for 2022 CWN MFSU BPAs. GACCs DO NOT have authority to place Orders under the BPAs. Resource Orders received from GACCs will result in separately priced EERAs written by a Buying Team or Local Contracting Office. National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC) – Only agency other than the CO with authority to place orders under the BPAs. Emergency Equipment Rental Agreement (EERA) – It is the governments intent to not issue EERAs for Call When Needed (CWN) MFSUs responding in support of an incident due to National MFS Units being fully committed or otherwise unavailable during the 2022 Fire Season. The purpose of 1202SC22Q2100 is to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) prior to the season in an effort to provide a more efficient dispatch process throughout, especially at times when there is an utmost need, similar to, and in-line with, current National dispatch procedures. This will eliminate time of order negotiations, allowing for quicker response to an incident.  Regional/Local incidents (<150 meals) – Dispatched via GACC via EERAs from regional/local offices or buying teams. GACCs will have access to the source list comprised of all Call When Needed (CWN) MFSU BPA awardees and will follow their own ordering procedures. Regional/local incidents are separate from the CWN MFSU BPA; EERA pricing is determined at time of order based on discussions at that time with that ordering official and will not be reflected against a BPA. Western United States – All states west of ND, SD, WY, CO, NM (occasionally TX and MN). Again, Call When Needed BPAs are for use only when a National MFS is not available. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- AMENDMENT (A01): The purpose of this amendment is to update Exhibit 11: Vendor Forest Service Incident Payment Information and provide clarification on CWN MFSUs. All other solicitation documents remain unchanged / there are no attachments for this amendment. Update Invoice Issues - invoice status questions email to asc_support@usda.gov. This change will be reflected in subsequent awards. This combined synopsis/solicitation is specifically for CWN MFSUs for use after all Nationally contracted MFSUs have been ordered or determined unavailable. GACCs can access a CWN MFSU BPA source list for regional/local use. USDA Forest Service CWN MFSU BPA holders are not precluded from accepting orders from GACCs on a separate EERA: CWN MFSUs are not required to provide pricing matching current BPA prices. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BASE: This combined synopsis/solicitation and resultant Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) are to provide Call When Needed (CWN) Mobile Food Service Units (MFSUs) at various field locations during wildland fire and other types of incidents throughout the contiguous western United States after all Nationally contracted MFSUs have been ordered or determined unavailable, and as the need becomes known to the Government. The expectation and desired result of the attached Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide appetizing, nutritional, well-balanced hot/cold meals, sack lunches, hot/cold can meals and supplemental items. All meals are to be freshly prepared at the incident (please see the SOW for complete details). This acquisition will result in commercial, multiple-award BPAs, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Products and Commercial Services in conjunction with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The BPA’s may be used by multiple State and Federal wildland fire agencies and will result in multiple agreements. The dollar limitation for any individual order is the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) ($7.5M IAW Agency procedure). Since the needs of the Government and availability of Contractor's resources during an emergency cannot be determined in advance, it is mutually agreed that, upon request of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish the resources listed herein to the extent the Contractor is willing and able at the time of order. Due to the sporadic occurrence of incident activity, the placement of any orders IS NOT GUARANTEED. Offerors shall complete the Schedule of Items – CWN MFSUs Item Detail and Price Schedule (attached separately) for the 2022 Calendar Year for all equipment and services they propose to offer. The Contractor is responsible for furnishing and managing all equipment, materials, supplies, trained/certified personnel, laborers, transportation and lodging necessary to meet the agreement specifications as identified in the SOW. Pricing/Terms for subsequent years will be requested annually through an updated combined synopsis/solicitation posted to SAM.gov. The effective period of the resultant BPAs will be June 1, 2022 – May 31, 2032, subject to Annual Review IAW FAR 13.303-6 and custom clause #4. The physical home location of the CWN MFSUs will be considered the Designated Dispatch Point (DDP) for the Offeror’s personnel and equipment. Wildland fire and other types of incidents occur in the contiguous western United States; BPAs will be established with MFS Units located in these areas.","Jun 20, 2023 05:00 PM MDT","Jun 2, 2023","Jun 2, 2023","Combined Synopsis/Solicitation","Dana Price","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","Food Service Contractors","FOREST-RANGE FIRE SUPPRESSION","N/A","N/A"

"12-3J14-Notice-23-034","USDA Aligns Transportation Requirements with Industry Practices to Reduce Barriers to Participation in USDA Commodity Procurement Food Purchase Programs","USDA Aligns Transportation Requirements with Industry Practices to Reduce Barriers to Participation in USDA Commodity Procurement Food Purchase Programs The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) today announced that beginning July 1, 2023, suppliers of food purchase programs administered by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) will no longer be required to use high security seals on trucks, railcars, vessels and other transports when transporting food products purchased to support those programs but will be allowed to use traceable tamper evident flat metal, wire or plastic commercial security seals. AMS’ Commodity Procurement Program made the change to align with current industry standard practices and reduce barriers to vendor participation in USDA food purchase programs. By aligning USDA requirements with commercial standards, USDA continues promoting competition by expanding the vendor pool and creating opportunities for smaller and minority-owned businesses. In February 2022, AMS and USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) co-published a request for information (RFI) on “Improving USDA Product Specifications and Distribution Requirements: Industry Perspectives” to gain feedback from industry suppliers of domestic food distribution programs and help USDA identify areas of improvement to the overall purchasing process for USDA Foods. In addition to the responses to the RFI, industry had previously expressed that the high security seal requirement is unique only to deliveries of food purchases by USDA. The Commodity Procurement Program assessed vendor responses, consulted other AMS subject matter experts, reviewed other USDA programs’ practices, and consulted AMS’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) liaison to ensure recommendations would align with FDA. AMS and FNS determined that removal of the high security seal requirement was feasible, and would have no  negative implications for USDA food purchase programs.

The scope covers Federal and Non-Federal lands within 150 miles of and including the administrative boundaries of the Idaho Panhandle, Nez Perce-Clearwater, Beaverhead-Deerlodge, Bitterroot, Custer-Gallatin, Flathead, Helena- Lewis and Clark, Kootenai, and Lolo National Forests and the Dakota Prairie Grasslands. Work may be accomplished on Non-Federal lands, but the BPA call will be issued and administered by a government entity. Multiple awards will be made for this BPA on an individual National Forest basis once the Forest Service has evaluated the technical proposals and pricing submitted in response to the solicitation. Examples of the types of Hazardous Fuels and Restoration work that may be included are cutting and removal of sawtimber, non-sawtimber, and/or biomass; mastication, hand cutting and piling; and road maintenance.  The period of performance of the awarded Blanket Purchase Agreements is 10 years from date of contract with option to extend up to 20 years. This BPA will be the primary means in which future Call Orders issued include: (1) Integrated Resource Service Contract (IRSC) with required timber product removal; (2) IRSCs that includes the option for Timber Subject to Agreement products to be removed when there is no required timber product removal; and (3) Restoration-based Service contract in which no timber product removal is included. Future Call Orders for specific projects will be emailed to only the Contractors awarded under this BPA. As such, it is imperative that all interested individuals have an email account, and that all firms must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov)  to be eligible for award under this solicitation. If not actively registered, the Forest Service will be unable to make a BPA award; thereby, effectively excluding an otherwise successful offeror from receiving a Call Order solicitation. Registration in SAM is a free service. Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) offers resources that are available free of charge at https://www.aptac-us.org/contracting-assistance/ in order to assist with both SAM registration and in proposal submission. Points of contact for this solicitation are: Matt Daigle, Acquisition Program Support Officer, National Stewardship Contracting Branch, matthew.daigle@usda.gov Questions must be submitted in writing and emailed to Matt Daigle. The Contracting Officer for this BPA is Mark T. Phillipp, National Stewardship Contracting Branch, and can be reached at mark.phillipp@usda.gov.","Mar 16, 2026 04:00 PM MDT","Mar 16, 2023","Mar 16, 2023","Solicitation","Matt Daigle, Stewardship Acquisition Program Support Officer","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","Support Activities for Forestry","OTHER NAT RES MGMT & CONSERV","N/A","N/A"

"12444823R0002","Forest Inventory and Analysis BPA Suite","The primary purpose of this effort is to advance scientific and technical knowledge and apply that knowledge to the extent necessary to achieve agency and national goals. The USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) effort, is part a national program responsible for collecting, analyzing, reporting, and distributing information and data about the extent, content, and condition of the Nation's rural and urban forests, as well as how much forest land exists and who owns it. FIA's research emphasis is on achieving specified objectives and knowledge rather than on achieving predetermined end results prescribed in a statement of specific performance characteristics. Crew leaders who complete this work will be working independently without a Forest Service employee present except for on a few hot checks. The US Forest Service will not direct the daily work assignments completed by crew leaders. There are four FIA Units with the Northern Research Station's FIA unit, having the responsibility for the comprehensive forest and urban inventory for 24 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. National, state, and local policymakers, universities, businesses, Tribal governments, National Forest managers, other natural resource agencies, and various interest groups depend on FIA for timely, scientifically credible information about our forests and urban landscape. FIA inventory plots are randomly located throughout the NRS Region with the vast majority of plots occurring on privately owned lands. Determining ownership of plot locations and gaining permission from landowners to complete the inventory is critical to the success of the project. In some cases more than one owner may need to be contacted to access a plot, this is especially true in urban settings. Communication skills and the ability to work independently are essential requirements of the work. Use of aerial photography, other imagery, maps, and previous FIA plot records may be necessary to accurately locate FIA plot locations and collect forest inventory resource data. This work requires regular and recurring physical exertion in the form of travel on foot over rough, uneven, and steep terrain. This work requires several hours of driving, several days each week with work locations changing frequently, often on a daily basis. Work areas may range from an urban environment to a remote wilderness area and everything else in between. The urban environment involves working in commercial, residential, and FIA plots are located across the entire contract area and overnight travel to access and complete many of the inventory plots in this contract will be a necessary. Access to some plots may require the use of watercraft as well as coordination with other public and private agencies. Additional NRS FIA program information can be found at: • http://fia.fs.fed.us/ • http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/fia/. • http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/fia/data-collection/ Additional NRS Urban FIA program information can be found at: • http://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/fia/urban/. • http://www.fs.fed.us/research/urban/fia. In Accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation part 35.007 Research and Development Contracting Solicitation, the submission and evaluation of an inordinate number of R&D proposals from sources lacking appropriate qualifications is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, the Contracting Officer will only provide the solicitation to sources technically qualified to perform. Potential sources will be qualified, as a result of: (1) Present and past performance of similar work; (2) Professional stature and reputation; (3) Relative position in a particular field of endeavor; (4) Ability to acquire and retain the professional and technical capability, including facilities, required to perform the work; and (5) Other relevant factors. Contractors MUST respond to this Sources Sought Notice. At this time the Contracting Officer will gather information on interested contractors. When the Statement of Work, Experience Questionnaire and Plot Type Tests are available they will be distributed to those that responded. Once those documents are returned the Government will evaluate the technical qualifications of the Offeror. ONLY contractors found be minimally technically qualified by the Contracting Officer will be included in the solicitation evaluation. Once a contractor is determined to be Technically Qualified, the solicitation will be released to that offeror. Once the offeror responds to the solicitation other evaluations will be made to determine more specific technical abilities, those evaluations may include contractor testing. If the contractor is found to be Technically Qualified, they will be awarded a five-year Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). The Government anticipates making multiple awards. Contractors awarded these BPAs shall constitute the Forest Inventory Analysis Suite of contractors. This BPA Suite is where future requirements shall be competed. Entry to the FIA BPA Suite is based entirely on technical qualifications of the contractor and individual staff members in key positions. This Sources Sought notice will be posted for the remainder of the calendar year, and contractors will be awarded a BPA as they are found technically competent and contractually responsible. This will result in multiple BPAs being awarded at different times, on different days.","Dec 31, 2023 11:59 PM CST","Feb 22, 2023","Feb 22, 2023","Sources Sought","Gayle Geiger | Colleen Reittinger","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology) ","Agriculture R&D  Services; Agricultural research and services; Basic Research","N/A","N/A"

"12363N23Q4038","NORTHERN ROCKIES STEWARDSHIP BPA","The Northern Rockies Stewardship BPA shall be awarded under the following authority: Stewardship Authority: Section 604 (16 USC 6591c) of Public Law 108-148 as amended by Section 8205 of Public Law 113-79, the Agricultural Act of 2014—Grants the U.S. Forest Service (Government) permanent authority to enter into stewardship contracts or agreements to achieve land management goals for the National Forests or public lands that meet local and rural community needs. Section 8205 supersedes the temporary authority granted to the Forest Service (Government) in section 347 of Public Law 105-277, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, 1999. Stewardship authorities permit the Government to solicit this requirement as Full and Open competition. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The USDA Forest Service Stewardship and Disaster Recovery Branch is currently preparing the Northern Rockies stewardship BPA. This BPA will issue future calls for individual Hazardous Fuels and Stewardship Restoration project areas in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The scope covers Federal and Non-Federal lands within 150 miles of and including the administrative boundaries of the Idaho Panhandle, Nez Perce-Clearwater, Beaverhead-Deerlodge, Bitterroot, Custer-Gallatin, Helena, Kootenai, Lewis and Clark and Lolo National Forests and the Dakota Prairie Grasslands. Work may be accomplished on Non-Federal lands, but the BPA call will be issued and administered by a government entity. Multiple awards will be made for this BPA on an individual National Forest basis once the Forest Service has evaluated the technical proposals and pricing submitted in response to the solicitation. Examples of the types of Hazardous Fuels and Restoration work that may be included are cutting and removal of sawtimber, non-sawtimber, and/or biomass; mastication, hand cutting and piling; and road maintenance.  The period of performance of the awarded Blanket Purchase Agreements is 10 years from date of contract with option to extend up to 20 years. This BPA will be the primary means in which future Call Orders issued include: (1) Integrated Resource Service Contract (IRSC) with required timber product removal; (2) Service-based IRSC that includes the option for Timber Subject to Agreement products to be removed when there is no required timber product removal; and (3) Restoration-based Service contract in which no timber product removal is included. Future Call Orders for specific projects will be emailed to only the Contractors awarded under this BPA. As such, it is imperative that all interested individuals have an email account, and that all firms must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov)  to be eligible for award under this solicitation. If not actively registered, the Forest Service will be unable to make a BPA award; thereby, effectively excluding an otherwise successful offeror from receiving a Call Order solicitation. Registration in SAM is a free service. Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) offers resources that are available free of charge at https://www.aptac-us.org/contracting-assistance/ in order to assist with both SAM registration and in proposal submission. Points of contact for this solicitation are: Matt Daigle, Acquisition Program Support Officer, National Stewardship Contracting Branch, matthew.daigle@usda.gov Questions must be submitted in writing and emailed to Matt Daigle. The Contracting Officer for this BPA is Mark T. Phillipp, National Stewardship Contracting Branch, and can be reached at mark.phillipp@usda.gov.","Mar 31, 2023 05:00 PM PDT","Jan 31, 2023","Jan 31, 2023","Presolicitation","Matt Daigle, Stewardship Acquisition Program Support Officer","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","Support Activities for Forestry","OTHER NAT RES MGMT & CONSERV","N/A","N/A"

Proposals for this BPA may be received for the life of the BPA. Proposals will be evaluated at the convenience of the Forest Service. Adds the following Forests to the BPA: Bighorn, Medicine Bow-Routt, Nebraska, Shoshone and Rio Grande National Forests. Changes Small Business Size Standard for NAICS 115310 from $8 Million to $30 Million for future call orders. Replaces the Instructions for Proposal, Solicitation and Appendix A in their enterity, updating with additional Forest information. Updates contact information for BPA.  The Rocky Mountain Restoration Project (RMRP) Stewardship BPA covers the Arapaho-Roosevelt, Bighorn, Black Hills, Grand Mesa-Uncompahgre-Gunnison, Medicine Bow-Routt, Nebraska, Pike-San Isabel, Rio Grande, San Juan, Shoshone, and White River National Forests This solicitation and any resultant Blanket Purchase Agreements are a service or Stewardship project in accordance with the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 amended as the “Permanent Stewardship Contracting Authority Act of 2013” under subsection (b) in accordance with Sec. 3903 of Title 41, U.S.C. This is a commercial-item acquisition that has been tailored to include fitting the Government’s method of trading goods for services in Stewardship instruments. Stewardship Authority: Section 604 (16 USC 6591c) of Public Law 108-148 as amended by Section 8205 of Public Law 113-79, the Agricultural Act of 2014—Grants the U.S. Forest Service (Government) permanent authority to enter into Stewardship contracts or agreements to achieve land management goals for the National Forests or public lands that meet local and rural community needs. Section 8205 supersedes the temporary authority granted to the Forest Service (Government) in section 347 of Public Law 105-277, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, 1999. Stewardship authorities permit the Government to solicit this requirement as Full and Open competition. Multiple awards will be made for this BPA on an individual National Forest basis once the Forest Service has evaluated the technical proposals and pricing submitted in response to the solicitation. Upon award, only the BPA awardees may bid on subsequent Call Order solicitations that are project specific. Some examples of the types of work included are cut and remove sawtimber, non-sawtimber and/or biomass; mastication, hand cutting, and piling; and road maintenance. The types of Call Orders that may be issued include: (1) Integrated Resource Service Contract (IRSC) with required timber product removal; (2) Service-based IRSC that includes the option for Timber Subject to Agreement products to be removed when there is no required timber product removal; and (3) Service contract in which no timber product removal is included. Request for Quotes (RFQ) of future Call Orders for specific projects will be emailed to only the Contractors awarded under this BPA. As such, it is imperative that all interested individuals have an email account, and all firms must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for award under this solicitation. If not actively registered, the Forest Service will be unable to make a BPA award; thereby, effectively excluding an otherwise successful offeror from receiving a Call solicitation. Registration in SAM is a free service. Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) offers resources that are available free of charge at www.aptac-us.org/find-a-ptac/ in order to assist with both SAM registration and in proposal submission. We encourage you to review the solicitation package and ask any questions you may have. This BPA will be the primary means in which IRSCs, Service-based IRSCs, and restoration-based service contracts will be issued in the future.

The award will be to purchase the following product/services: The USDA ARS, Fayetteville, AR requires an annual service contract for a Leica - Confocal Stellaris microscope. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:  Contract will be for the period of 11/24/2022-11/23/2023 (Base) Service and scientific expertise pertaining to the Leica Stellaris confocal microscope systems (including the Leica Stellaris 5); technical training and expertise using Leica Stellaris confocal microscope systems in real-world applications and experiments with ability to provide on-site visit for scientific training and discussion of experimental setup and design pertaining to use of the Stellaris 5 confocal system; technical training and expertise on Leica Stellaris part replacement and microscope system servicing.

NFSR 35 is a 0.8 mile long single lane paved road that acts as a ‘cutoff’ between NFSR 210 and TN-165. In order for NFSR 35 to be utilized as a Detour Route during bridge construction, the contractor will be responsible for performing reconditioning activities to include clearing, excavation, milling of asphalt, sub-grade stabilization, culvert cleaning/replacement, fill slope armoring and paving. The road reconditioning activities will need to be completed prior to Tellico River Road being closed for bridge construction. Scope- Bridge Replacement The Bald River Falls Bridge project will replace the existing 3-span, 200 ft bridge with a new 2-span structure. The existing structure is a two lane, 20 ft wide bridge comprised of concrete abutments, steel girders, concrete deck and 2 concrete piers. The new structure will be 170 ft long two lane structure with sidewalk and observation deck. The structure will be founded on bedrock with shallow foundation spread footings. The abutments/wingwalls will include rock anchors for support. The superstructure will be pre-stressed concrete box beams. A single 3-column concrete pier will be located at center span.

Stewardship authorities permit the Government to solicit this requirement as Full and Open competition. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This BPA will issue future calls for individual Hazardous Fuels and Restoration project areas. The scope covers Federal and Non-Federal lands within 150 miles of and including the administrative boundaries of the Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino, Coronado, Kaibab, Prescott, Tonto, Carson, Cibola, Gila, Lincoln, and Santa Fe National Forests.

"12363N21Q4021","SIMON STEWARDSHIP IRSC - Black Hills National Forest, Mystic Ranger District, South Dakota","Amendment 0001 issued 08/03/2021 with Revised Schedule of Items. Due Date not extended. The Simon Stewardship IRSC shall be awarded under the following authority: Stewardship Authority: Section 604 (16 USC 6591c) of Public Law 108-148 as amended by Section 8205 of Public Law 113-79, the Agricultural Act of 2014—Grants the U.S. Forest Service (Government) permanent authority to enter into stewardship contracts or agreements to achieve land management goals for the National Forests or public lands that meet local and rural community needs. Section 8205 supersedes the temporary authority granted to the Forest Service (Government) in section 347 of Public Law 105-277, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, 1999. Stewardship authorities permit the Government to solicit this requirement as Full and Open competition. The project is located approximately 7 miles northwest of Hill City, South Dakota within T01N R03E, Sections 13, 24-26 and 36; T01N R04E, Sections 17-23 and 27-31, Pennington County, South Dakota The purpose and need for the Simon Stewardship in the McVey project area is to remove the planted off site seed stock that is not regenerating, and to replant native black hills seed stock after commercial harvests, prescribed fire, and fuels reduction treatments in order to maintain and increase the forest resilience to disturbance while producing future timber, forage and habitat outputs in support of forest plan goals. This project proposes the removal of poorly-formed ponderosa pine stock from within the historic 1939 McVey burn area. The project also proposes vegetative management activities that would improve the growth, vigor and health of the residual pine that survived the fire. These residual trees are an important seed source for natural pine regeneration. Within the planted and seeded areas, the Simon Stewardship proposes a mosaic pattern of vegetative treatments that may include, but are not limited to, clear cuts, clear-cut with reserves, hardwood release and restoration, meadow restoration, and establishment cuts where there is a native seed source. Non-commercial thinning may occur throughout the project area. Associated fuel treatments may include mastication, piling and/or burning of the slash. Post-harvest activities will include planting with native Black Hills ponderosa pine stock to return the site to a productive and healthy state. Total National Forest System (NFS) area within the planted polygons in the Simon Project Area is approximately 4,375 gross acres. There is no road reconstruction but there will be an estimated 8.9 miles of road maintenance as service work under the Simon Stewardship to support the commercial timber activities. Estimated Timber is as follows: Ponderosa Pine Sawtimber   9,375 CCF Ponderosa Pine POL                     469 CCF NAICS: 115310: Support Services for Forestry, size standard: 20.5M Fuels Management Services.

"72029418R00002","R--Accelerated Competitiveness Enterprises (ACE) RFP","Dear Prospective Offerors: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about March 9, 2018 for an anticipated five-year Cost Plus Fixed-Fee term Contract for the USAID/WBG â€œAccelerated Competitiveness for Enterprisesâ€? (ACE) Project. The overall goal of the Project is to increase global competitiveness as well as private sector-led economic growth in the West Bank and Gaza through providing problem-solving services to Palestinian firms in order to enable them to expand sales and exports and generate increased investment. These increases will result in the creation of new jobs, which will increase the incomes of people currently unemployed or underemployed, including women and youth, contributing thereby to a growing, inclusive economy. The anticipated Project will apply a market-driven approach starting with the market â€“ operationally, buyers â€“ and work backwards to help firms solve the constraints that stand in the way of their selling more and increasing sales and profitability. The Project consists of two primary components as follows: 1. Component I will focus on transactional support where the Contractorâ€™s technical assistance will help firms take the actions required to address the client firmsâ€™ business problems with business solutions and ultimately increase sales, exports, investment, productivity, and jobs. 2. Component II will work with firms as well as private sector growth-focused entities, such as trade and business organizations or government institutions, to focus on removing systemic constraints (policy or institutional) that prevent sales transactions from taking place. Prospective Offerors are advised that issuance of the RFP solicitation and award of a contract are subject to the availability of funds, as certain procedural and legislative requirements for obligating funds have not yet been met. The place of performance under the anticipated contract is the West Bank and Gaza.","N/A","Apr 18, 2018","Apr 18, 2018","Solicitation","Zakariya, Nevine nzakariya@usaid.gov","Active","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","SUPPORT SVCS (PROF, ADMIN, MGMT)","N/A","N/A"
